A briefly introduction about what you will see in this blog. <!--more--> 
## About
I'll write mostly about macroeconomics and finance. And sometimes about Corinthians...

## Methodology
Instead of a pure rhetoric (the main weapon we economists have), i'll keep my analysis based on data visualization and some insights from econometric models.

## Dashboard
For the most recurrent subjects, like data releases and asset prices, i'll use a proprietary [Dashboard](https://lfpazevedo.pythonanywhere.com/) built in Python.
