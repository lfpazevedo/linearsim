## Beef on the rise.

[IBGE](https://www.ibge.gov.br/) released today the latest data on the 2024 IPCA.

Once again, beef prices made the largest contribution to the headline inflation rate. This marks the fourth consecutive month of abnormal price increases in this category.

The price hikes were observed across all cuts, including more affordable options like _chuck_ (_Ac√©m_). Typically, these prices tend to rise during the first half of the year due to seasonal factors, such as tax payments and school supply expenses.
