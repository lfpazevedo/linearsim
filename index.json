[{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"Financial price return distributions are not Gaussian. Extreme events occur far more often than predicted by the normal curve, and human behavior (particularly panic selling) amplifies downside moves, making the distribution of returns left-skewed.\nDuring these extreme events, volatility measures spike. Therefore, adding volatility derivatives (futures, swaps, or even straddles and strangles) to your portfolio can help capture diversification benefits in the higher moments of the distribution.\nIn this post, I’ll assume we have these instruments available for both the USA and Brazil, and add volatility strategies to a portfolio of bonds and equities. In reality, volatility derivatives are scarce and/or very expensive, often undermining or even making such strategies infeasible.\nI will add two measures to the bond and equity portfolio: implied volatility and the volatility risk premium (the difference between implied and realized volatility over a certain period). For the Implied measure (Long Volatility – LV), I will assume it can be purchased as an index and then we observe the PnL after a set period. The PnL for the Volatility Risk Premium (VRP) will be the difference between LV and realized volatility over one month.\nBecause implied volatility is forward-looking—traders might add a premium to option prices ahead of an election, for example—it is considered a better predictor of future volatility than realized volatility, at least outside of crisis periods (check this comparison between implied and realized volatility during crises). The PnL comes from the difference between these two measures.\nFor bond indexes, I used the S\u0026amp;P U.S. Treasury Bond Index (calculated by S\u0026amp;P) and the IMA (calculated by Anbima). For equity, I used the S\u0026amp;P 500 and the IBOV indexes. For implied volatility, I used the VIX for the USA and the S\u0026amp;P/B3 Ibovespa VIX for Brazil. Realized volatility was calculated using daily data over a one-month period. Finally, I included the 30-Day Average SOFR and CDI as risk-free rates.\nHere is the plot of the series used in this post (weekly frequency):\nTo build the return of the volatility strategies, I leveraged the notional so that the Modified Value-at-Risk (ModVaR) of the volatility strategies would match the ModVaR of the equity strategy. Modified VaR is the traditional VaR expanded via a Taylor series to include up to the fourth moment of the distribution.\nBelow is the correlation matrix:\nUSA Brazil The IMA and IBOV show a high weekly correlation, which contrasts with the U.S. market. In both markets, we see a strong negative correlation between LV and equity, while VRP has a smaller correlation.\nHere are the descriptive statistics for each individual return series:\nUSA Asset Class Geometric Mean Annualized Geometric Mean Median Minimum Maximum Annualized Standard Deviation Skewness Kurtosis Annualized Downside Deviation Modified VaR Sharpe Ratio Success Rate Bond 0.02% 1.13% 0.06% -1.89% 2.22% 4.56% 0.19 0.90 3.19% 0.97% 0.34 52.82% Equity 0.20% 10.99% 0.51% -16.23% 11.42% 18.69% -0.89 7.10 13.49% 4.27% 0.81 57.91% Long Volatility 0.33% 18.53% -0.44% -17.50% 62.11% 53.70% 2.23 13.62 27.92% 4.25% 0.66 42.94% VRP 0.56% 33.68% 1.03% -25.37% 4.76% 18.91% -5.12 38.21 16.25% 4.24% 2.07 79.66% Brazil Asset Class Geometric Mean Annualized Geometric Mean Median Minimum Maximum Annualized Standard Deviation Skewness Kurtosis Annualized Downside Deviation Modified VaR Sharpe Ratio Success Rate Bond 0.14% 7.82% 0.18% -2.04% 1.69% 3.48% -0.74 3.36 2.81% 0.71% 2.71 67.18% Equity -0.01% -0.51% 0.08% -7.56% 6.78% 16.75% 0.03 0.44 12.50% 3.75% -0.06 50.77% Long Volatility 0.20% 11.09% 0.20% -7.05% 10.78% 18.56% 0.47 1.46 12.30% 3.57% 0.89 52.82% VRP 3.83% 605.09% 4.20% -9.49% 12.32% 28.92% -0.96 1.72 13.18% 3.55% 45.90 88.72% Because the ModVaR of equity determined the leverage for the volatility strategies, the risk measure is similar across them.\nEven though LV’s Sharpe ratio is lower, it can still help with portfolio diversification due to its positive skewness.\nIn Brazil’s sample, there is no clear risk–reward trade-off between bonds and equities—bonds have both a lower return and lower volatility than equities.\nHigher-Moment Correlations Now let’s check the correlations in the higher moments.\nUSA Coskewness Bond² Equity² LV² VRP² Bond*Equity Bond*LV Equity*LV Bond 0.19 0.33 0.77 -0.04 Equity -0.21 -0.89 -1.29 0.45 LV 0.38 0.80 2.22 -0.07 -0.41 VRP -0.36 -1.82 -0.43 -5.10 -0.06 -0.03 0.47 Cokurtosis Bond³ Equity³ LV³ VRP³ Bond*Equity² Bond*LV² Bond*VRP² Equity*LV² Equity*VRP² Bond²*Equity Bond²*LV Equity²*VRP LV²*VRP EquityLVVRP Bond 3.87 -1.07 5.44 1.26 2.18 2.80 2.14 0.41 Equity 0.15 9.98 -9.67 -7.04 -1.07 -3.02 0.10 6.20 12.64 LV 0.99 -5.01 16.41 0.95 1.65 -2.78 -1.87 -1.90 VRP -0.16 3.08 -3.49 40.66 -0.81 -1.08 2.42 0.54 -0.82 2.02 Brazil Coskewness Bond² Equity² LV² VRP² Bond*Equity Bond*LV Equity*LV Bond -0.74 -0.13 -0.50 -0.26 Equity -0.40 0.03 -0.36 -0.12 LV 0.60 0.27 0.47 0.19 0.32 VRP -0.55 -0.22 -0.22 -0.95 -0.33 0.33 0.15 Cokurtosis Bond³ Equity³ LV³ VRP³ Bond*Equity² Bond*LV² Bond*VRP² Equity*LV² Equity*VRP² Bond²*Equity Bond²*LV Equity²*VRP LV²*VRP EquityLVVRP Bond 6.25 2.17 -2.42 0.56 2.61 3.58 2.06 -1.02 Equity 3.61 3.40 -2.28 0.35 2.17 2.18 1.00 2.06 1.03 -0.71 LV -3.66 -1.79 4.39 -0.77 -1.77 -0.61 -2.52 -0.71 -1.70 0.93 VRP 1.94 0.40 -1.70 4.64 0.69 1.28 0.93 1.14 -1.55 1.52 -0.61 A positive coskewness between assets i;i;ji; i; ji;i;j (i.e., twice i, once j) means that asset j has a high return when the volatility of asset i is high. In other words, j is a good hedge against spikes in i. For both the USA and Brazil, the LV strategy is a good hedge when the other assets are volatile.\nFor cokurtosis, positive values for i;i;i;ji; i; i; ji;i;i;j indicate a more negatively skewed distribution for asset i when asset j’s return is lower. This holds for VRP versus equity in the USA, and for bonds and equity in Brazil.\nPositive values in i;i;j;ki; i; j; ki;i;j;k signal that the covariance between j and k increases when the volatility of i increases. In the USA, the covariance between equities and VRP increases when LV volatility is high. In Brazil, equity and VRP covariance is higher in periods of high bond volatility.\nFinally, i;i;j;ji; i; j; ji;i;j;j \u0026gt; 0 means the volatility of i and j increases together. We observe this with bonds and LV in both countries.\nEfficient Frontiers (Mean–ModVaR) I built the efficient frontier in terms of mean versus Modified VaR (returns vs. VaR).

Economic fundamentals are among the main drivers of foreign exchange price fluctuations. For long-term analysis, interest rate differentials can explain the overvalued BRL during the 2000s, while purchasing power parity (PPP) could be the main reason for the continuous appreciation of currencies in Eastern countries (“could” because we may need more than 100 years of data to prove that PPP really works...).\nSince interest rate differentials (hereafter carry) typically display long memory—remaining in the same plateau for months at a time—it may be necessary to split the data into regimes when explaining short-term price changes of currencies.\nBehavioral models can be used for this type of short-term analysis. This approach uses Market Sentiment and Expectations as inputs. Cognitive biases, herding, and overreaction, among others, will affect sentiment and thus the FX price.\nSo, in this post, I’ll present some interesting notes about Behavioral Models across different regimes determined by fundamental variables. Given the BRL carry level1, investors will react differently to the VIX (a global shock) or to shocks in Economic Policy Uncertainty (a local shock).\nThe Model [ Y_t \\sim c + Y_{t-1} + X_t + Z_t ]\nWhere:\n(Y) is the monthly log-return of USD/BRL, (X = [\\mathrm{lag_USDBRL}, \\mathrm{EPU}, \\mathrm{VIX}]), and (Z) is the rate differential (the regime applies to (Z)). As mentioned, carry doesn’t explain much of the short-term fluctuation in FX. The table below shows the relative importance of each variable in an OLS regression.\nVariable Coefficient Standardized Beta Partial R² Share of Forecasted Variance Shapley R² Share lag_usd 0.2695 0.2709 0.0731 0.3798 0.3645 epu 0.0169 0.2252 0.0501 0.2626 0.2801 vix 0.0476 0.2583 0.0658 0.3454 0.3513 ir_diff -0.0377 -0.0302 0.0009 0.0047 0.0040 This low explanatory power is not a problem for the current study, since the maximum (R^2) reached by this simple analysis is also low (as is common with FX regressions). The 3D plot below shows how the (X) parameters evolve over time (using a 5-year regression window). The goodness-of-fit, as measured by (R^2), is lower than 0.2.\nNevertheless, the figure above reveals some interesting clusters. Splitting the beta-EPU distribution in two, we see higher BRL sensitivity to local risks from 2016 to 2018. This period also exhibits higher betas on the lagged USD variable and lower VIX sensitivity. During these years, there was also a consistent drop in the BRL carry:\nGiven these signals, it makes sense to run regressions for different carry regimes to see how these parameters behave.\nFull Sample Regression First, let’s examine the full sample regression, which includes observations since 2009.\nThe calculated endogenous threshold is 0.109, yielding 145 months of low-carry (R_1) (low by this univariate measure) and 38 observations above it ((R_2)).\nParameter R1 Value R2 Value cs 0.0174 0.0115 phi1 0.153 0.284 beta1 0.00191, 0.02833 0.001378, -0.000409 delta1 -0.154 -0.0724 sigma 0.0906 0.175 In (R_2), BRL inertia is higher (coefficient (\\phi_1)). Changes in EPU generate a similar impact (the first element of (\\beta_1)), while the beta for VIX is null, signaling that global shocks only affect the currency if the carry is not high. Increases in carry appreciate the BRL (negative (\\delta_1) coefficients), but with a higher magnitude in the low-carry regime.\nAs often noted in this blog, parameters in financial markets change significantly over time. Therefore, let’s check how the parameters evolved over time. In regime-switch analysis, this is crucial, because 10% carry might be considered low by today’s standards but could have been considered high a few years ago.2\nUsing a 10-year regression window for the first estimation and then adding one month at a time (i.e., not a fixed window), the grid below shows the evolution of the parameters since 2019. The Bayesian estimate presented some noise, so I added a 12-month moving average to the parameter time series for visualization.\nBetas for lag-USD Betas for EPU Betas for VIX Betas for Carry Below is a 3D visualization of the smoothed parameters:\nNotably, EPU beta was higher for the low regime in 2023, reinforcing the conclusion that investors are more willing to tolerate risk if the carry is sufficiently attractive. Check my personal dashboard with economic and finance data here.\n1st footnote – For FX behavior models, the best measure of carry is the interest rate implied by the options market. For this study, however, I’m simply using the difference between the 2-year U.S. Treasury yield and the Brazilian 504-day fixed rate (as calculated by Anbima).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n2nd footnote – Of course, we need to test whether the data truly exhibits a regime switch. Since this blog’s intention is only to share interesting data and thoughts, let’s pretend the regime-switch model is superior to a simple linear OLS.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/post/fx-regime/","section":"post","tags":["ARModels","Econometrics","FX","InterestRates","RiskAversion"],"title":"Risk Aversion in Different Carry Regimes"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/riskaversion/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"RiskAversion"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/series/data-release/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Data Release"},{"body":"Interest Rate Sensitivity to Economic Data Releases The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) releases monthly data on inflation and economic activity. The main inflation indicators are IPCA and IPCA-15 (same methodology but different price collection), in addition to monthly surveys for Industry, Retail, and Services (PIM, PMC, PMS, respectively). IBGE also publishes monthly Unemployment data, but due to its relatively short time series, I will not include it in the modeling proposed in this post.\nUsing the ARCH framework to model the fixed-for-floating swap in Brazil (Swap Pré-DI), I added dummies for release days to the variance equation of an EGARCH model, which allows for asymmetry in interest rate variations. I modeled the mean equation as an ARMA(1,1) process and used a Student’s t-distribution for the errors.\nI utilized five years of daily data (from 2012 to 2017) to estimate the parameters, and then continued collecting the estimated parameters until 2025. The distribution of these parameters provides several interesting conclusions:\nSwap Pré-DI volatility is higher on IPCA release days for every vertex of the curve. Shorter vertices show a decrease in volatility on IPCA-15 release days. Economic activity data do not show a significant impact on volatility at any vertex. Here are the t-statistics used to check parameter significance:\nFrom this analysis, one might conclude that only IPCA matters for the interest rate market in Brazil. However, remember that we operate in a regime-changing environment. The “market radar” evolves over time.\nSo, let's add time as a new dimension to these plots. Below, I plot only the parameters of the equation that explains the 252-day Pré-DI rate, which the BCB uses in its models.\nThe following graph shows that from 2012 to 2017, the activity parameters were estimated as positive, whereas more recent estimates indicate they contribute to reducing volatility.\nThe T-statistics plot shows that PMC and PMS are closer to –2, indicating they might be nearing statistical significance.\nWouldn't it be great to add the economic surprise—actual released data vs. economists’ forecasts—to the mean equation? What about a dummy in the variance equation for days when Central Bank staff members appear in the media? Luckily, we already have such a study!

Therefore, for this post, I used the USDBRL daily series made orthogonal to VIX (specifically, the residual from an OLS regression). If we have a global shock, USD and VIX will move in the same trend and the regression error will be small. Otherwise, a higher error implies the shock was likely local.\nBelow is a plot of the features used to explain the excess return of the Brazilian stocks in the current Ibovespa index composition:\nFocus’s GDP forecast for the next 12 months shows a significant increase during the pandemic period. This does not represent an actual revision for better economic conditions; rather, it is a base adjustment due to the economic downturn from the Covid crisis—essentially a denominator error. We should treat this data accordingly, but, for simplicity proposes, I'll keep the variable as it is. We should treat this data accordingly, but for simplicity, I will keep the variable as it is. Focus and VIX are properly treated to capture surprises (you can find more details here).\nAnother factor used to explain the excess return of stocks is the market risk factor. This variable decomposes stock returns into their idiosyncratic and systematic components, allowing us to apply the macro-factor regression only on the idiosyncratic series. I could use the BOVA11 contract to represent the market factor, but instead, I used PCA as a proxy. I also used only the current Ibovespa composition, which may cause some optimization and risk-neutralization issues, but for the purpose of this post, I'll keep it simple.\nChecking the data Some sectors respond more strongly to certain factors than others. The Covid global shock affected the Industrial sector more than the Consumer Staples sector:\nSector Cumulative Return Sector Cumulative Return Real Estate experienced a significant downturn during the local news episode in May 2017, and Consumer Discretionary company prices declined during the 2022 growth revision period.\nSector Cumulative Return Sector Cumulative Return Now that I have fitted each stock using a set of features, let’s build a statistical arbitrage model and compare the portfolio metrics with and without macro-features.\nModel For the purposes of this post, I could use any statistical model. Again, I’ll keep it simple and use a model similar to moving averages. Cointegration and other econometric models would also work.\nBelow is an example signal for ASAI3. An open position was signaled at the beginning of 2023 and closed in June. Depending on the portfolio weights after risk-return optimization, this signal could generate substantial returns.\nOptimization I set a constraint allowing only 10% for a long or short position in the same stock. For December 12, 2024, we have the following portfolio. On this date, the portfolio is fully short on ITSA4 and fully long on B3SA3.\nI also added some beta neutrality conditions, which will be discussed in the risk section.\nBacktest Finally, the main section of this post: Does the inclusion of macro-features improve portfolio metrics?\nThe image below shows the PnL (Profit and Loss) of three portfolios and their sector breakdown. The “Optimal Overall” portfolio uses only the market factor as an explanatory variable, and that factor was constrained to zero during optimization. The red line, “Featured Optimal,” shows the PnL of a strategy that includes macro-features in the regressions. In that strategy as well, only the market beta was neutralized. Finally, because VIX includes futures contracts, we could use them to neutralize the beta of that factor; the results are similar to those of the Featured Optimal PnL.\nThe table below shows each portfolio’s metrics, with a highlight on drawdown. In this case, adding macro-features could save a hedge fund’s life!\nPortfolio Annualized Return Annualized Volatility Sharpe Ratio Max Drawdown 95% VaR Optimal Overall 0.084 0.209 0.400 -50.032 -0.021 Featured Overall 0.064 0.209 0.308 -5.670 -0.020 VIX Overall 0.064 0.208 0.309 -5.596 -0.021 Risk Because the market factor proxy is not perfect, the optimization could not fully neutralize it.

Is it time to bet on global risks? Given the next election, should we hedge?\nIMPORTANT CONCLUSION: Some factors (like VIX and the market factor) can be neutralized by available market instruments. But others (like Growth and the News factor) cannot!!!

Clearly, these factors are uncorrelated. Regressions of gold prices against rainfall and gold prices against federal funds rates, or a single regression of gold prices against both rainfall and federal funds rates, would yield similar betas.\nIgnoring causality tests—to preserve my visually appealing plots—I built some factors that, theoretically, should be orthogonal. Using the betas from individual regressions, I clustered Brazilian stocks that compose the Ibovespa Index.\nGiven Brazil's limited influence on global financial markets, we can argue that global shocks are not caused by local Brazilian shocks. Furthermore, we can stretch this argument and suggest that policy uncertainty is not strongly related to economic growth (good luck to entrepreneurs trying to optimize production amidst the constant news flow from Brasília...).\nIn this context, I developed three proxies to represent global risk aversion, local risk aversion, and local growth. Why only three? To create visually pleasing 3D plots...\nGlobal risk aversion: Represented by the VIX volatility index, based on options from the S\u0026amp;P 500. Local risk aversion: Measured by the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, which tracks keywords in Brazilian news. Local growth: Derived from GDP growth forecasts in the Focus Report collected by the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB). Quarterly forecasts were interpolated to create a 12-month-ahead GDP forecast proxy. Since price changes reflect unpredictable news, I used the error of an AR(1) process as a proxy for surprises. A volatile month predicts another volatile month, and the same principle applies to EPU. We can also assume inertia in forecast changes.\nBelow is the correlation between the constructed factors. While the correlations are not zero, they are close enough to zero to support the assumption of near-orthogonality.\nAnother way to visualize pairwise correlations is as follows:\nThe low correlations confirm we're on the right track. Some stock prices respond to global risk aversion, while others are more sensitive to local factors. The coefficients align with economic logic: stock prices drop when EPU and VIX rise unexpectedly, while they increase with positive GDP growth forecast revisions.\nThe clustering results are summarized below. For example, some banks cluster together—this makes sense—but other combinations, like Aviation and Healthcare, may seem unrelated.\nThe plot suggests the presence of approximately five clusters (the silhouette score also supports this—higher is better). ALOS3 and BRAV3 are outliers, forming their own clusters. For visual purposes, I removed these stocks from the dataset, resulting in three clusters.\nNumber of Clusters Silhouette Score 2 0.51 3 0.53 4 0.50 5 0.48 6 0.47 7 0.49 8 0.49 9 0.51 10 0.50 We observe that some stocks in Cluster 2 are particularly sensitive (relatively speaking) to local risk aversion, while their sensitivity to Focus and VIX factors is comparable.\nAs mentioned earlier, I did not assess parameter significance or regression goodness-of-fit. This study simply highlights the importance of identifying nearly orthogonal factors that represent different risks affecting stock prices.\nIf you want to take a step forward, you can use this type of clustering approach to enhance hedge and arbitrage strategies.\nAppendix Parameters and clusters—monthly data from 2015 to 2024:\nTicker Betas EPU Betas VIX Betas Focus Cluster ASAI3 -19.97 -0.62 0.17 0 AURE3 94.48 -15.85 0.12 0 BRAP4 35.00 -8.86 0.37 0 BBAS3 8.25 -17.46 0.49 0 BRFS3 -8.43 -12.92 0.61 0 CMIG4 -8.60 -13.71 0.70 0 CPLE6 29.74 -15.89 0.88 0 ELET3 -42.87 -6.14 0.42 0 ELET6 -49.57 -7.27 0.47 0 GGBR4 -7.52 -15.64 0.15 0 GOAU4 13.27 -11.80 0.21 0 GOLL4 -47.14 -5.48 0.04 0 JBSS3 -30.24 -7.05 0.53 0 MGLU3 -4.44 -4.55 0.40 0 MRFG3 53.28 -10.35 0.68 0 PETR4 -45.44 -19.06 0.76 0 PRIO3 2.20 -14.58 0.46 0 SUZB3 -39.66 -11.05 0.61 0 TAEE11 -25.36 -23.08 0.94 0 UGPA3 -45.47 -15.44 0.51 0 USIM5 15.06 -9.82 0.22 0 VALE3 72.10 -7.57 0.34 0 AZUL4 -69.07 -9.11 -0.26 1 AZZA3 -123.02 -18.46 0.34 1 B3SA3 -90.56 -13.64 0.48 1 BBSE3 -131.60 -27.23 0.71 1 BBDC3 -84.53 -15.17 0.31 1 BBDC4 -91.50 -13.78 0.28 1 BRKM5 -130.83 -14.33 0.61 1 CCRO3 -77.24 -18.48 0.85 1 CMIN3 -101.81 -4.80 0.07 1 COGN3 -116.98 -15.16 0.40 1 CRFB3 -97.78 -0.56 -0.29 1 CXSE3 -84.65 -1.61 0.37 1 EMBR3 -110.12 -12.05 -0.56 1 ENGI11 -155.00 -23.48 1.03 1 ENEV3 -126.09 -7.39 0.26 1 EQTL3 -156.84 -21.83 0.49 1 EZTC3 -77.39 -11.09 -0.05 1 FLRY3 -133.17 -24.33 0.52 1 HAPV3 -92.16 -7.88 0.40 1 IRBR3 -85.58 -13.31 -0.20 1 ITSA4 -82.35 -18.54 0.41 1 ITUB4 -76.93 -15.19 0.14 1 JHSF3 -70.42 -11.23 0.10 1 KLBN11 -123.25 -23.72 0.53 1 LIGT3 -60.20 -10.92 0.26 1 LREN3 -94.91 -13.98 0.51 1 MRVE3 -107.47 -12.63 0.18 1 MULT3 -94.91 -25.04 0.81 1 PCAR3 -62.41 -1.65 -0.14 1 PETR3 -59.56 -20.54 0.73 1 QUAL3 -104.49 -8.13 -0.02 1 RAIL3 -61.68 -7.01 0.41 1 RENT3 -59.13 -21.21 0.47 1 SANB11 -102.78 -16.87 -0.10 1 SBSP3 -134.70 -15.54 0.54 1 TIMS3 -162.28 -21.89 0.74 1 VIVT3 -91.51 -4.58 0.25 1 WEGE3 -72.16 -16.41 0.39 1 YDUQ3 -71.16 -11.47 0.36 1 ABEV3 -272.94 -23.84 -0.25 2 BPAC11 -190.08 -21.11 0.16 2 EGIE3 -195.52 -27.75 1.17 2 HYPE3 -191.58 -15.27 0.33 2 RADL3 -265.02 -14.53 0.31 2 TOTS3 -205.54 -22.62 0.77 2 Check my personal dashboard with economic and finance data here\n","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/post/ibov-clusters/","section":"post","tags":["Finance","Econometrics","RegressionAnalysis","RiskAversion","Clustering","BrazilianStocks","Ibovespa","DataVisualization","ARModels","Orthogonality"],"title":"Clustering Stocks"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/series/curiosity/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Curiosity"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/datavisualization/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"DataVisualization"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/ibovespa/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Ibovespa"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/orthogonality/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Orthogonality"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/regressionanalysis/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"RegressionAnalysis"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/ibge/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IBGE"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/ipca/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IPCA"},{"body":"Beef on the rise.

Now, we can be more ambitious and scrape retail or wholesale prices for any desired location worldwide.\nWhen it comes to short-term inflation forecasting, the highest level of data disaggregation and localized price scraping is the crème de la crème.
