The main inflation indicators are IPCA and IPCA-15 (same methodology but different price collection), in addition to monthly surveys for Industry, Retail, and Services (PIM, PMC, PMS, respectively). IBGE also publishes monthly Unemployment data, but due to its relatively short time series, I will not include it in the modeling proposed in this post.\nUsing the ARCH framework to model the fixed-for-floating swap in Brazil (Swap Pré-DI), I added dummies for release days to the variance equation of an EGARCH model, which allows for asymmetry in interest rate variations. I modeled the mean equation as an ARMA(1,1) process and used a Student’s t-distribution for the errors.\nI utilized five years of daily data (from 2012 to 2017) to estimate the parameters, and then continued collecting the estimated parameters until 2025. The distribution of these parameters provides several interesting conclusions:\nSwap Pré-DI volatility is higher on IPCA release days for every vertex of the curve. Shorter vertices show a decrease in volatility on IPCA-15 release days. Economic activity data do not show a significant impact on volatility at any vertex. ![[images/data-release/file-20250209221939815.png]]\nHere are the t-statistics used to check parameter significance:\n![[images/data-release/file-20250209221834065.png]]\nFrom this analysis, one might conclude that only IPCA matters for the interest rate market in Brazil. However, remember that we operate in a regime-changing environment. The “market radar” evolves over time.\nSo, let's add time as a new dimension to these plots. Below, I plot only the parameters of the equation that explains the 252-day Pré-DI rate, which the BCB uses in its models.\nThe following graph shows that from 2012 to 2017, the activity parameters were estimated as positive, whereas more recent estimates indicate they contribute to reducing volatility.\n![[images/data-release/file-20250209221945233.png]]\nThe T-statistics plot shows that PMC and PMS are closer to –2, indicating they might be nearing statistical significance.\n![[images/data-release/file-20250209221837543.png]]\nWouldn't it be great to add the economic surprise—actual released data vs. economists’ forecasts—to the mean equation? What about a dummy in the variance equation for days when Central Bank staff members appear in the media? Luckily, we already have such a study!

Therefore, for this post, I used the USDBRL daily series made orthogonal to VIX (specifically, the residual from an OLS regression). If we have a global shock, USD and VIX will move in the same trend and the regression error will be small. Otherwise, a higher error implies the shock was likely local.\nBelow is a plot of the features used to explain the excess return of the Brazilian stocks in the current Ibovespa index composition:\nFocus’s GDP forecast for the next 12 months shows a significant increase during the pandemic period. This does not represent an actual revision for better economic conditions; rather, it is a base adjustment due to the economic downturn from the Covid crisis—essentially a denominator error. We should treat this data accordingly, but, for simplicity proposes, I'll keep the variable as it is. We should treat this data accordingly, but for simplicity, I will keep the variable as it is. Focus and VIX are properly treated to capture surprises (you can find more details here).\nAnother factor used to explain the excess return of stocks is the market risk factor. This variable decomposes stock returns into their idiosyncratic and systematic components, allowing us to apply the macro-factor regression only on the idiosyncratic series. I could use the BOVA11 contract to represent the market factor, but instead, I used PCA as a proxy. I also used only the current Ibovespa composition, which may cause some optimization and risk-neutralization issues, but for the purpose of this post, I'll keep it simple.\nChecking the data Some sectors respond more strongly to certain factors than others. The Covid global shock affected the Industrial sector more than the Consumer Staples sector:\nSector Cumulative Return Sector Cumulative Return Real Estate experienced a significant downturn during the local news episode in May 2017, and Consumer Discretionary company prices declined during the 2022 growth revision period.\nSector Cumulative Return Sector Cumulative Return Now that I have fitted each stock using a set of features, let’s build a statistical arbitrage model and compare the portfolio metrics with and without macro-features.\nModel For the purposes of this post, I could use any statistical model. Again, I’ll keep it simple and use a model similar to moving averages. Cointegration and other econometric models would also work.\nBelow is an example signal for ASAI3. An open position was signaled at the beginning of 2023 and closed in June. Depending on the portfolio weights after risk-return optimization, this signal could generate substantial returns.\nOptimization I set a constraint allowing only 10% for a long or short position in the same stock. For December 12, 2024, we have the following portfolio. On this date, the portfolio is fully short on ITSA4 and fully long on B3SA3.\nI also added some beta neutrality conditions, which will be discussed in the risk section.\nBacktest Finally, the main section of this post: Does the inclusion of macro-features improve portfolio metrics?\nThe image below shows the PnL (Profit and Loss) of three portfolios and their sector breakdown. The “Optimal Overall” portfolio uses only the market factor as an explanatory variable, and that factor was constrained to zero during optimization. The red line, “Featured Optimal,” shows the PnL of a strategy that includes macro-features in the regressions. In that strategy as well, only the market beta was neutralized. Finally, because VIX includes futures contracts, we could use them to neutralize the beta of that factor; the results are similar to those of the Featured Optimal PnL.\nThe table below shows each portfolio’s metrics, with a highlight on drawdown. In this case, adding macro-features could save a hedge fund’s life!\nPortfolio Annualized Return Annualized Volatility Sharpe Ratio Max Drawdown 95% VaR Optimal Overall 0.084 0.209 0.400 -50.032 -0.021 Featured Overall 0.064 0.209 0.308 -5.670 -0.020 VIX Overall 0.064 0.208 0.309 -5.596 -0.021 Risk Because the market factor proxy is not perfect, the optimization could not fully neutralize it. The graphs below show that the portfolios’ sensitivity to BOVA11 is far from neutral.\nHere are the metrics only for the “VIX Overall” portfolio.\nBOVA11 BOVA11 VIX VIX Focus Focus News News Risk analysis helps us identify exposures and optimize management decisions. Is it time to bet on global risks? Given the next election, should we hedge?\nIMPORTANT CONCLUSION: Some factors (like VIX and the market factor) can be neutralized by available market instruments. But others (like Growth and the News factor) cannot!!! This highlights the importance of having an economist in a quantitative fund to predict how these factors might move.\nCheck my personal dashboard with economic and finance data here\n","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/post/macro-factor-model/","section":"post","tags":["Finance","Econometrics","BrazilianStocks","Risk","Portfolio"],"title":"Statistical arbitrage with macro-factors"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/armodels/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ARModels"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/clustering/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Clustering"},{"body":"Checking Betas Over (Almost) Orthogonal Factors If we have two uncorrelated (orthogonal) explanatory variables, we get the same betas whether we run a single regression that includes both variables or two separate regressions for each variable.\nFor instance, heavy rainfall in Australia affects gold prices, and U.S. monetary policy also affects gold prices. Clearly, these factors are uncorrelated. Regressions of gold prices against rainfall and gold prices against federal funds rates, or a single regression of gold prices against both rainfall and federal funds rates, would yield similar betas.\nIgnoring causality tests—to preserve my visually appealing plots—I built some factors that, theoretically, should be orthogonal. Using the betas from individual regressions, I clustered Brazilian stocks that compose the Ibovespa Index.\nGiven Brazil's limited influence on global financial markets, we can argue that global shocks are not caused by local Brazilian shocks. Furthermore, we can stretch this argument and suggest that policy uncertainty is not strongly related to economic growth (good luck to entrepreneurs trying to optimize production amidst the constant news flow from Brasília...).\nIn this context, I developed three proxies to represent global risk aversion, local risk aversion, and local growth. Why only three? To create visually pleasing 3D plots...\nGlobal risk aversion: Represented by the VIX volatility index, based on options from the S\u0026amp;P 500. Local risk aversion: Measured by the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, which tracks keywords in Brazilian news. Local growth: Derived from GDP growth forecasts in the Focus Report collected by the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB). Quarterly forecasts were interpolated to create a 12-month-ahead GDP forecast proxy. Since price changes reflect unpredictable news, I used the error of an AR(1) process as a proxy for surprises. A volatile month predicts another volatile month, and the same principle applies to EPU. We can also assume inertia in forecast changes.\nBelow is the correlation between the constructed factors. While the correlations are not zero, they are close enough to zero to support the assumption of near-orthogonality.\nAnother way to visualize pairwise correlations is as follows:\nThe low correlations confirm we're on the right track. Some stock prices respond to global risk aversion, while others are more sensitive to local factors. The coefficients align with economic logic: stock prices drop when EPU and VIX rise unexpectedly, while they increase with positive GDP growth forecast revisions.\nThe clustering results are summarized below. For example, some banks cluster together—this makes sense—but other combinations, like Aviation and Healthcare, may seem unrelated.\nThe plot suggests the presence of approximately five clusters (the silhouette score also supports this—higher is better). ALOS3 and BRAV3 are outliers, forming their own clusters. For visual purposes, I removed these stocks from the dataset, resulting in three clusters.\nNumber of Clusters Silhouette Score 2 0.51 3 0.53 4 0.50 5 0.48 6 0.47 7 0.49 8 0.49 9 0.51 10 0.50 We observe that some stocks in Cluster 2 are particularly sensitive (relatively speaking) to local risk aversion, while their sensitivity to Focus and VIX factors is comparable.\nAs mentioned earlier, I did not assess parameter significance or regression goodness-of-fit. This study simply highlights the importance of identifying nearly orthogonal factors that represent different risks affecting stock prices.\nIf you want to take a step forward, you can use this type of clustering approach to enhance hedge and arbitrage strategies.\nAppendix Parameters and clusters—monthly data from 2015 to 2024:\nTicker Betas EPU Betas VIX Betas Focus Cluster ASAI3 -19.97 -0.62 0.17 0 AURE3 94.48 -15.85 0.12 0 BRAP4 35.00 -8.86 0.37 0 BBAS3 8.25 -17.46 0.49 0 BRFS3 -8.43 -12.92 0.61 0 CMIG4 -8.60 -13.71 0.70 0 CPLE6 29.74 -15.89 0.88 0 ELET3 -42.87 -6.14 0.42 0 ELET6 -49.57 -7.27 0.47 0 GGBR4 -7.52 -15.64 0.15 0 GOAU4 13.27 -11.80 0.21 0 GOLL4 -47.14 -5.48 0.04 0 JBSS3 -30.24 -7.05 0.53 0 MGLU3 -4.44 -4.55 0.40 0 MRFG3 53.28 -10.35 0.68 0 PETR4 -45.44 -19.06 0.76 0 PRIO3 2.20 -14.58 0.46 0 SUZB3 -39.66 -11.05 0.61 0 TAEE11 -25.36 -23.08 0.94 0 UGPA3 -45.47 -15.44 0.51 0 USIM5 15.06 -9.82 0.22 0 VALE3 72.10 -7.57 0.34 0 AZUL4 -69.07 -9.11 -0.26 1 AZZA3 -123.02 -18.46 0.34 1 B3SA3 -90.56 -13.64 0.48 1 BBSE3 -131.60 -27.23 0.71 1 BBDC3 -84.53 -15.17 0.31 1 BBDC4 -91.50 -13.78 0.28 1 BRKM5 -130.83 -14.33 0.61 1 CCRO3 -77.24 -18.48 0.85 1 CMIN3 -101.81 -4.80 0.07 1 COGN3 -116.98 -15.16 0.40 1 CRFB3 -97.78 -0.56 -0.29 1 CXSE3 -84.65 -1.61 0.37 1 EMBR3 -110.12 -12.05 -0.56 1 ENGI11 -155.00 -23.48 1.03 1 ENEV3 -126.09 -7.39 0.26 1 EQTL3 -156.84 -21.83 0.49 1 EZTC3 -77.39 -11.09 -0.05 1 FLRY3 -133.17 -24.33 0.52 1 HAPV3 -92.16 -7.88 0.40 1 IRBR3 -85.58 -13.31 -0.20 1 ITSA4 -82.35 -18.54 0.41 1 ITUB4 -76.93 -15.19 0.14 1 JHSF3 -70.42 -11.23 0.10 1 KLBN11 -123.25 -23.72 0.53 1 LIGT3 -60.20 -10.92 0.26 1 LREN3 -94.91 -13.98 0.51 1 MRVE3 -107.47 -12.63 0.18 1 MULT3 -94.91 -25.04 0.81 1 PCAR3 -62.41 -1.65 -0.14 1 PETR3 -59.56 -20.54 0.73 1 QUAL3 -104.49 -8.13 -0.02 1 RAIL3 -61.68 -7.01 0.41 1 RENT3 -59.13 -21.21 0.47 1 SANB11 -102.78 -16.87 -0.10 1 SBSP3 -134.70 -15.54 0.54 1 TIMS3 -162.28 -21.89 0.74 1 VIVT3 -91.51 -4.58 0.25 1 WEGE3 -72.16 -16.41 0.39 1 YDUQ3 -71.16 -11.47 0.36 1 ABEV3 -272.94 -23.84 -0.25 2 BPAC11 -190.08 -21.11 0.16 2 EGIE3 -195.52 -27.75 1.17 2 HYPE3 -191.58 -15.27 0.33 2 RADL3 -265.02 -14.53 0.31 2 TOTS3 -205.54 -22.62 0.77 2 Check my personal dashboard with economic and finance data here\n","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/post/ibov-clusters/","section":"post","tags":["Finance","Econometrics","RegressionAnalysis","RiskAversion","Clustering","BrazilianStocks","Ibovespa","DataVisualization","ARModels","Orthogonality"],"title":"Clustering Stocks"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/series/curiosity/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Curiosity"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/datavisualization/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"DataVisualization"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/ibovespa/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Ibovespa"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/orthogonality/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Orthogonality"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/regressionanalysis/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"RegressionAnalysis"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/riskaversion/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"RiskAversion"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/ibge/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IBGE"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/ipca/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"IPCA"},{"body":"Beef on the rise.
