IBGE released today the latest data on the 2024 IPCA.\nOnce again, beef prices made the largest contribution to the headline inflation rate. This marks the fourth consecutive month of abnormal price increases in this category.\nThe price hikes were observed across all cuts, including more affordable options like chuck (Acém). This pattern is typical at the start of the year, driven by seasonal factors such as tax payments and back-to-school expenses. These obligations take a significant portion of household budgets, leaving consumers with less money to purchase expensive cuts like Picanha.\nSeasonal and time-series plots For a deeper analysis, including core inflation and aggregate data, check out my dynamic Dashboard .

Every corner store can share its prices with the entire planet.\nFor a quantitative economist, this “corner store” is like a playground of endless possibilities.\nBefore we had onIn the past, only a few marketplaces published food prices—like Ceagesp anb local Ceasas in major Brazilian cities—and some institutions, such as ESALQ focused on commodity prices in selected regions. Now, we can be more ambitious and scrape retail or wholesale prices for any desired location worldwide.\nWhen it comes to short-term inflation forecasting, the highest level of data disaggregation and localized price scraping is the crème de la crème. Even without collecting new price data, we can demonstrate the power of disaggregation in a simple forecasting exercise. The table below shows the regional weights of Brazil’s inflation as measured by the (IPCA).\nSurveyed Areas INPC Weight IPCA Weight BRASIL 100.00 100.00 Rio Branco 0.72 0.51 Belém 6.95 3.94 São Luís 3.47 1.62 Fortaleza 5.16 3.23 Recife 5.60 3.92 Aracaju 1.29 1.03 Salvador 7.92 5.99 Belo Horizonte 10.35 9.69 Vitória 1.91 1.86 Rio de Janeiro 9.38 9.43 São Paulo 24.60 32.28 Curitiba 7.37 8.09 Porto Alegre 7.15 8.61 Campo Grande 1.73 1.57 Goiânia 4.43 4.17 Brasília 1.97 4.06 Source: IBGE, Diretoria de Pesquisas, Coordenação de Índices de Preços. Population and income data from POF 2017-2018. In a vast and diverse country like Brazil, variations in rainfall distribution and cultural practices make seasonality highly visible in the data, especially for fresh produce.\nBelow, you can see the inflation seasonality plots for 1105001.Lettuce in Curitiba (South) and Fortaleza (Northeast):\nYou can observe that the larger temperature swings in Curitiba have a stronger effect on price variation compared to Fortaleza.\nHere is the difference in consumer budget weights for the two cities:\nLocation Regional Weight Local Weight* Country Weight Brazil 100.0 0.1193 100% x 0.1193 = 0.1193 Curitiba 7.37 0.1474 7.37% x 0.1474 = 0.01086338 Fortaleza 3.23 0.0409 3.23% x 0.0409 = 0.00132107 Weight as on 2024-11 I ran a simple model (an LSTM with a 12-month-ahead horizon and 12 lags as features) on the IPCA category 1105.Vegetables and greens (since greens are perishable, non-tradeable goods, potential arbitrage between cities is reduced) for the aggregate “Brazil” and its regional composition.\nNext, I forecast each sub-item within this category on a regional basis and calculated the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of each forecast:\nSNIPC Code Subitem Country Weight 1105 Vegetables and greens 0.243 1105001 Lettuce 0.1193 1105004 Coriander 0.0076 1105005 Kale 0.0169 1105006 Cauliflower 0.0033 1105010 Cabbage 0.0178 1105012 Parsley 0.0478 1105019 Broccoli 0.0304 Location LSTM (Desagg.)

Conversely, this weight is negative for March in such years. Naturally, the opposite occurs when Carnival is in March.\nSince IBGE releases the parameters to calculate the holiday's economic impact begin-before=-4/end-before=-1, we can use the software Genhol to calculate these weights whenever needed.\nThe official date of Carnival is a Tuesday. However, I couldn’t match the published spreadsheet values available in IBGE's FTP repository using this date. Assuming IBGE truly uses the specified days before the holiday, the only plausible source of error must come from the holiday date file Carnaval.dat, which is missing from the repository.\nAfter adjustments—setting the official day to Wednesday for certain years—I successfully replicated the exact values:\nOriginal Date Replacement Date 2022-03-01 2022-03-02 2003-03-04 2003-03-05 2014-03-04 2014-03-05 2025-03-04 2025-03-05 Genhol weights Interestingly, for Corpus Christi, another movable holiday, this issue was not encountered.\nYou can find the script for this study on my Github Repository.\nFeel free to send me PRs—let’s unravel the mystery of the Carnaval.dat file together!\n","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/post/genhol-carnival/","section":"post","tags":["IBGE","Seas","Genhol"],"title":"On the quest for the Carnaval.dat file"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/categories/programming/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Programming"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/categories/finance/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Finance"},{"body":"","link":"https://lfpazevedo.github.io/linearsim/tags/introduction/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Introduction"},{"body":"A briefly introduction about what you will see in this blog.\nAbout I'll write mostly about macroeconomics and finance.
